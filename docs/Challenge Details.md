<h2> Challenge Rules  </h2> <span style="color:magenta"> *current tentative version </span>.

<ul>
<li>Participants can *only* use the audio and transcriptions provided to build their systems. They can choose to use the corresponding language’s data to build each system or combine the data and use it cross-lingually.
</li>

<li>Participants are expected to sign an agreement when they download the data and are expected to use the data only for research purposes. Participants who register but do not submit a system to the challenge are required to withdraw from the challenge.
</li>

<li>If registered participants feel that they cannot submit a system, they will have to submit a withdrawal clause that states that they will not use the data for any other purposes. Only participants who submit systems to the challenge will be allowed to use the data in the future for research purposes.
</li>

<li>The systems submitted are expected to beat the baseline system in terms of WER, however, innovative systems that come close to the baseline may be considered.
</li>

<li>Only the audio for the blind test set (5 hours) will be released. Participants are expected to run their systems on the blind test set and submit the ASR hypotheses to us for evaluation. Participants will need to share their final ASR model, along with the paper to be able to reproduce the hypotheses against the blind set.
</li>

</ul>

<h2> The challenge comprises two sub-tasks as described below: </h2>

<h3> Multilingual ASR (sub-task1) </h3>
This sub-task involves building a multilingual ASR system in six languages, namely, Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Telugu, Tamil, and Gujarati. The blind test set will comprise recordings from a subset (or all) of these six languages

<h3> Code-switching ASR (sub-task2) </h3>
This sub-task involves building a code-switching ASR system separately for Hindi-English and Bengali-English code-switched pairs. The blind test set will comprise recordings from these two code-switched language pairs.
<br>

Submissions to this special session should show results on one or more of the above mentioned tasks. Submissions on any topic related to building multilingual code-switching ASR are welcome. This includes (but is not limited to):
<ul>
  
<li> Acoustic modeling for multilingual ASR models </li>
<li> Language modeling for multilingual ASR models </li>
<li> Multilingual ASR model for code-switching </li> 
<li> Language modeling for code-switching </li> 
<li> Linguistically informed models for code-switching </li>
